      From voice & chat copilots to integrations and internal tools,

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a technical problem-solver who enjoys working where systems, people,
      and process intersect. Most of my work lives behind the scenes —
      keeping applications reliable, integrations clean, and teams unblocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve worked across startups and established organizations, which has taught
      me how to balance speed with stability. If something breaks in production
      or confuses users, I take that personally.
