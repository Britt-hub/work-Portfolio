  <h2>About me</h2>

  <p>
    I’m an application and integration specialist who likes working at the intersection
    of systems, people, and problem-solving. Most of my work lives in production —
    supporting copilots, integrations, and workflows that teams rely on every day.
  </p>

  <p>
    I care a lot about building things that are practical, resilient, and human.
    If it breaks at 2am or confuses agents, it’s not “done.”
