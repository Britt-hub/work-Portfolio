        From voice & chat copilots to integrations and internal tools,

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a technical problem-solver who works where systems, people,
        and process intersect. Most of my work lives behind the scenes —
        keeping applications reliable, integrations clean, and teams unblocked.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve worked across startups and established organizations, which taught me
        how to balance speed with stability. If something breaks in production
        or confuses users, I take that personally.
